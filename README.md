## My first article on Scala variance

[Scala variance symptoms ->](https://dev.to/hackus/scalas-variance-30og)

## My second 

### Contravariance
If my function accepts a param of type T it can accept a subtype of type T
### Covariance
If my function returns an object of type T it can also return an object of subtype of T
### Invariance
If my function accepts a param of type T only objects of type T are accepted, if my function returns an object of type T only objects of type T are returned

## Note
Compilation failures in this project are intended
